# PV_PA_Calculator

This program is used to calculate the quantity of parts that need to be ordered to build 'n' number of desired products. It requires selecting a CSV file exported from Parts and Vendors with accurate quantities before running (i.e., export an up-to-date inventory list). The desired product to build must be the top level item in the CSV file.
